### Overview of the project
This code is used to evaluate the influence of several molecular descriptors and dimension reduction on chemical space.
This project is part of my bachelor end project at Leiden university, at the computational drug discovery group at the LACDR. 

### File structure
[data inladen + filter.ipynb](data inladen + filter.ipynb) is used to select a subset of data from the Papyrus database.
[calculating_descriptors.ipynb](calculating_descriptors.ipynb) is used to calculate 2D descriptors, morgan fingerprints and pharmacophore fingerprints of the data.
